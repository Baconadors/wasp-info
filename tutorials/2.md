### Introduction

In this short guide I'm going to teach you guys how to install OSRS in Debian 10 Linux. This can be done in other distros but might need some tweaks which will be up to you.

### Process

This guide to run OSRS in linux can be split into 4 parts:

- Install dependencies
- Create an update script
- Run the client

### Installing dependencies

You only need java and a tool to extract msi files.
You can get both with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt install default-jre msitools -y
```

### Create update script

This is going to be a quite simple script.
You can just run the commands if you want but having a script is nice to be able to update the client easily in the future if you ever need to.

The script in a nutshell is going to do the following:

- Download the windows OSRS .msi installer
- Extract the files from the installer
- Move the client to the place we want

To create the update script first create a new file, I'll call mine `update-osrs.sh` and I'll be using `nano`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
mkdir /tmp/osrs
cd /tmp/osrs
wget -O OldSchool.msi http://www.runescape.com/downloads/OldSchool.msi
msiextract OldSchool.msi
sudo cp /tmp/osrs/jagexlauncher/jagexlauncher/bin/jagexappletviewer.jar /usr/local/bin/jagexappletviewer.jar
sudo cp /tmp/osrs/jagexlauncher/jagexlauncher/oldschool/jagexappletviewer.png /usr/local/share/jagexappletviewer.png
sudo chmod 755 /usr/local/bin/jagexappletviewer.jar
rm -rf /tmp/osrs
```

Now we can run the script with:

```bash
sudo bash ~/update-osrs.sh
```

### Optionally steps

This steps are completely optional.

#### Alias

First we are going to make a command alias. A command alias is a shorter command you can type to run a long one.
This is because to launch osrs right now you would have to type this everytime:

```bash
java -Duser.home=osrs -Xss2m -Xmx512m -Djava.class.path=/usr/local/bin/jagexappletviewer.jar -Dcom.jagex.config=http://oldschool.runescape.com/jav_config.ws jagexappletviewer /usr/local/share/
```

So we are going to make an alias, you will be able to type only `osrs` in the terminar and the game will launch:

```bash
echo 'alias osrs="java -Duser.home=osrs -Xss2m -Xmx512m -Djava.class.path=/usr/local/bin/jagexappletviewer.jar -Dcom.jagex.config=http://oldschool.runescape.com/jav_config.ws jagexappletviewer /usr/local/share/"' | sudo tee --append /etc/bash.bashrc
```

#### Desktop icon

Now you might as well want to have a desktop icon to double click.
This will vary a lot from desktop manager to desktop manager but the most common way is this is to create the following file:

```bash
touch /usr/share/applications/osrs.desktop
```

And add the following text to it via `nano` or whatever you would like:

```bash
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Exec=java -Duser.home=osrs -Xss2m -Xmx512m -Djava.class.path=/usr/local/bin/jagexappletviewer.jar -Dcom.jagex.config=http://oldschool.runescape.com/jav_config.ws jagexappletviewer /usr/local/share/
Name=Official OSRS Client
Comment=Official OSRS Client launcher
Icon=/usr/local/share/jagexappletviewer.png
Categories=Game
```

And that's it. You have OSRS "installed" and you can now run it ðŸ˜„
